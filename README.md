# Mahsa

# Description
Mahsa Chat App is a Flutter-based chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. The app utilizes various technologies such as Riverpod for state management and Firebase for the backend, including Firebase Authentication, Cloud Storage, and Realtime Database.

# Features
## User Authentication: 
Users can sign up and log in to the app using their credentials. Firebase Authentication is used to securely handle user authentication and account management.

## Chat Listing Screen: 
Upon logging in, users are presented with a chat listing screen. Only the chats where the user is a member or an admin are visible to them.

## Group Search and Join: 
The app provides a group search screen where users can search for specific groups. Users can request to join a group, and the group's admin has the authority to accept or reject the request.

## Group Messaging: 
Each group consists of two rooms: a general room where all members can send messages and an admin room where only the admin can post messages. Users can participate in group conversations, share updates, and communicate with other members.

## Group Creation: 
Users have the ability to create their own groups within the app. As an admin of a group, they can manage the group's settings, including adding or removing members.
